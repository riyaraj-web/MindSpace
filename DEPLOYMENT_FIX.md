# Mindspace Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Environment Variables**: Added proper environment variable handling for production
2. **Error Boundary**: Added error boundary to catch JavaScript errors
3. **Loading States**: Improved loading state handling in AuthContext
4. **Build Configuration**: Updated Vite config for better production builds
5. **Fallback UI**: Added loading fallback in index.html

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues - add error boundary and improve env handling"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Redeploy your project
- The app should now load properly

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
In your Vercel dashboard, you can set these environment variables:
- `VITE_DEV_MODE=true`
- `VITE_APP_NAME=Mindspace`
- `VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0`

## Debugging

If you still see a white screen:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and check for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests
3. **Check Loading**: The app should show a loading spinner initially

## What Was Wrong

The main issues were:
- Missing error boundary to catch JavaScript errors
- Environment variables not properly configured for production
- AuthContext potentially getting stuck in loading state
- No fallback UI while the app initializes

## Testing Locally

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open http://localhost:4173 to see the production version.
